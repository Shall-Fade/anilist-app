# AniList App

This project was created to upgrade my skills and experience.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search required anime by name
- Filter anime by genre / rating / format / status / year
- See full details of each anime
- Add anime to watch list
- Remove anime from watch list
- **In developing**: Toggle light and dark mode
- **In developing**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe) - Unofficial MyAnimeList API
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com) - Promise Based HTTP Client For The Browser
- [VUE](https://vuejs.org) - JS Framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - Frontend Tooling
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) - State Management Library
- [vuex-persistedstate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuex-persistedstate) - Persist And Rehydrate Your Vuex State Between Page Reloads.
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org) - Router For Vue.js.

### What I learned

Learned how to persist Vuex states with (vuex-persistedstate). Understood how to use dynamic mapping of routes with parameters. Realized a project that I wanted for a long time;)

### Continued development

In the future, you need to:

- Adapt the project to other devices
- Make a change of dark and light mode.
- Finish About Page
- Finish the page with information about the anime
- Add Preloader
- Add drag and drop for watched anime.
- Add registration and authorization
- Add other lists
